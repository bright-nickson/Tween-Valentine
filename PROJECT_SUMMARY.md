## 🎯 The Cursor Prompt

I've included `CURSOR_PROMPT.md` which contains:

- Code patterns
- Common enhancement requests

**How to use it:**

1. Open your project in Cursor
2. Paste the prompt from `CURSOR_PROMPT.md`
3. Ask for specific improvements like:
   - "Add loading spinner to payment button"
   - "Improve mobile spacing"
   - "Add animation to course cards on scroll"
